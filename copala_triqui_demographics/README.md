# Copala Triqui language survey

This was a joint project with Lauren Clemens where we analyzed language use by Copala Triqui speakers living in diaspora in New York, California, and Mexico. We examined demographic factors like gender, age, and location in relation to reading, writing, speaking, and comprehension in Triqui, Spanish, and English. Our findings were presented at the Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (SSILA) and Congreso de Lenguas Otomangues y Vecinas (COLOV IX).
