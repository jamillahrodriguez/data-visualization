# CiTonga depressor consonants

In this joint project with Winfred Mkochi and Lee Bickmore, I analyzed the change in pitch on verb stems following depressor consonants vs. non-depressor consonants in Malawian CiTonga, a Bantu language. My main role in this collaboration was statistical analysis. Any remaining statistical errors are my own!

All data was recorded from the first author native speaker and pitch tracks were time normalized in Praat.

A publication with our findings is available [here](https://www.njas.fi/njas/article/view/822).

The files here include:

* Annotated files with pitch tracks and vowel measurements
  * `mean-pitch-tracks.csv`
  * `pitch-tracks.csv`
  * `vowel-measurements.csv`
 
* An R script for exploration and analysis

* Several plots printed from the R script above
