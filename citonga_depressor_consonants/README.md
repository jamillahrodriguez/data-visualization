# CiTonga depressor consonants

In this joint project with Winfred Mkochi and Lee Bickmore, I looked at the change in pitch after depressor consonants vs. non-depressor consonants in Malawian CiTonga. My main role in this collaboration was statistical analysis. Any statistical errors are my own!

All data was recorded from the first author native speaker and pitch tracks were time normalized.

A publication with our findings is available [here](https://www.njas.fi/njas/article/view/822).

The files here include:

* Annotated files with pitch tracks and vowel measurements:
  * `mean-pitch-tracks.csv`
  * `pitch-tracks.csv`
  * `vowel-measurements.csv`
 
* An R script for exploration and analysis

* Several graphs printed from the R script above
